## About CPD3DS

CPD3DS integrates CATH and SCOP/SCOP2 , in order to provide as comprehensive and detailed structure domain information as possible.  At present, we have achieved remarkable results in four aspects: design ideas  originality , data integrity, content accuracy and user-friendliness.

1.  Initiated domain classification according to the shape of domain through 3DZD & K-means.
2. Through Uniprot, CATH, SCOP/SCOP2 and PDB, we have integrated domain division, related functions and probability combination into our own project website, so as to form a complete system of domain shape division, sequence, structure, function and evolutionary relationship. 
3. We use an authoritative database recognized by the synthetic biology community. Their strict review system and supporting materials ensure the accuracy of the content on our website. 

We strive to make CPD3DS a more integrated and user-friendly database that provides synthetic biologists with long-term, stable data updates and search services. 

Currently,  the team has developed very practical functions on CPD3DS and plan to develop it further.

## Protein brick

Hope to make the idea of ynthetic biology more accessible and easier to the public, we decided to develop a puzzle game. Protein brick comes out.

### Usage

After clone, go to folder Protein_Block where contain all we need. Just run .exe in the protein brick file directly to play.
